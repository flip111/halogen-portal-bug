# Redux Todo Example

The redux-todo example is a clone of the [official Redux todo list example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos). It demonstrates how to implement multiple independent stores and reducers and how to then combine them together into a single central store and reducer.

Large real-world applications will likely need to follow an approach similar to the one demonstrated here to keep multiple stores manageable.
